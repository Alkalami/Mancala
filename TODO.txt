# What Must Be Done Before We Submit #

### Features and Tasks ###
[ ] Implement two graphical layouts w/ images. @steven
[ ] Javadoc all (public only?) methods.
[ ] Update UML Class Diagram.
[ ] Create UML Sequence Diagram
[ ] Play like 50 games each to make sure it works well.

### Bug Fixes ###
[ ] somethingChanged() not always called.
[X] Player Label does not refresh. @andrew?
[X] MDialog can be closed by the [X] button of the Window.
	In .Net it is possible to remove this button. Maybe better to just show dialog
	again until they pick something. Doubt she will try but you never know.
[ ] It is currently possible to take a null turn. i.e. choose a pit with 0 stones.
